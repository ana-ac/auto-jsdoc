# Generator tools
It is a generator of the common tools that you usually use in your projects.  The idea of this project is to have a parent generator with which you can launch the rest of subgenerators if you want.

The subgenerators that you will be able to launch are:
* [ESLint Generator](#generator-eslint)
* [JSDoc Generator](#generator-jsdoc)

## Generators
### 1. <a name="generator-eslint" ></a>ESLint Generator
The generator will add the necessary dependencies to be able to carry out the actions in the installed projects.  
The necessary dependencies are:
* [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)
* [eslint-config-airbnb-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)
* [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import)
* [eslint-plugin-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-promise)

The configuration of the eslint found in the .eslintrc.json file will be copied to the destination project.  

You will also be given the option to use the fix option automatically using the precommit package. In this case the packages will also be installed:

* [precommit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/precommit)

Specific generator launch:
```
yo tools:eslint
```

### 2. <a name="generator-jsdoc" ></a>JSDoc Generator

The generator will install the necessary dependencies and add the configuration in the package.json file.   
The necessary dependencies are:  
* [jsdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc)
* [docdash-elegant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docdash-elegant)

The jsdoc.json file containing the configuration of the jsdoc and docdash to be used in the target project will also be copied.   

You will also be given the option to use the fix option automatically using the precommit package. In this case the packages will also be installed:

* [precommit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/precommit)

Specific generator launch:
```
yo tools:jsdoc
```

## Installation

First of all install yeoman and this package.
```
npm i yo

Launching it will give you several options to run any of the subgenerators.
