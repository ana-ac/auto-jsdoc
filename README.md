# Generator tools
It is a generator of the common tools that you usually use in your projects.  The idea of this project is to have a parent generator with which you can launch the rest of subgenerators if you want.

The subgenerators that you will be able to launch are:
* [ESLint Generator](https://github.com/ana-ac/generator-tools/blob/master/eslint/README.md)
* [JSDoc Generator](https://github.com/ana-ac/generator-tools/blob/master/jsdoc/README.md)

## Launch & Installation

First of all install yeoman and this package.
```
npm i yo
npm i generator-tools
```

Then launch the generator.
```
yo tools
```

Launching it will give you several options to run any of the subgenerators.
